* Get a moves export from [https://accounts.moves-app.com/export](https://accounts.moves-app.com/export)
* Unpack the `moves_export.zip` and then unpack the `json.zip`
* Go to the timeframe you want to map, go to `storyline` and pick the date you want. Copy that json file to this `datasource` directory here.
* Open `map.php` in an editor, change `$source` to the filename of the file you just picked. (This will get better, at some point. Probably.)
* Open your browser, go to `map.php`
